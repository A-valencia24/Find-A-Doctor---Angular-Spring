# Find-A-Doctor---Angular-Spring
P2 group project
Search for a doctor nearby given the desired specialties or general practice. Book appointment through website. Define the desired capabilities (i.e. requirements) of this portal. The requirements should be ideally expressed from the perspective of a patient who wants to visit the hospital/clinic for consultation and/or procedure. Patient - Insurance Provider â€“ Doctor affiliation mapping should be built into the application.
