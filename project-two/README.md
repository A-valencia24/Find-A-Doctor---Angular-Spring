<p>This section is dedicated to making a front end website that is appealing to the patient, user-friendly to doctors, and properly integrates with the controllers.</p>
<p>Utilizing past project's PatientController, a simple set was able to be made and tested. However, I am having unfamiliarity getting it to communicate with the more modern controllers we have made in Spring. This will be discussed further with my team and Tufail, as the meat of this part will come after the controllers are set up and I properly grasp how to communicate them together.</p>
